### Theory based on two demo's: a functional - and an object-oriented one

* Fundamentals of JavaScript (Constructor Functions, Context(this)(objecten), Scope(fucnties/blocks))
* Functions and Closures (Callbacks, Returning Functions, Binding Functions)
* Array Manipulation and Logical Operations (Array Methods, Short-Circuiting, Event Delegation)
* Async Programming in JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await)
* Code Flow and Control Structures (Defensive Programming, Return Early, object destructuring, spread operator)
* Advanced JavaScript Concepts (Chaining Methods, Concurrency Model, Event Loop (Call Stack, Event Queue, and Microtask Queue), Hoisting, Closure)

Bron: You Don't Know JS

Topics we encounter when using the debugger from the **Sources** tab in DevTools:
* Application state
* Scope 
* Context (this)
* Call Stack (Concurrency Model / Single thread)
* Extra: modules (scoped, deferred, async)


### Practical applications in a SvelteKit Project

Opdracht Refactor your JavaScript:
* Object destructuring
* Short circuiting
* Spread operator
* One responsibility rule for functions
* Pseudo-Private Custom Properties (Scope CSS)

Decide which conventions you apply to your work.
